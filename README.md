- Hi. I’m Víctor (@VictorFMR), an indie game designer / developer. 
- I have worked as a UX designer and researcher as well, and for a long time I was a marketing specialist and a content developer (yes, I'm pretty old, tempus fugit).
- I’m interested in science, poetry, art, games and programming (currently improving my C++ skills).
- I’m working in a couple of quite interesting but also time consuming projects right now, so not really willing to get into new ones at the moment, but who knows?
- See you around.
