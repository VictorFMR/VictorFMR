- Hi. I’m Víctor (@VictorFMR).
- I have worked as a UX designer and researcher, and for a long time I was a marketing specialist and a content developer (yes, I'm pretty old, <em>tempus fugit</em>).
- I have some skills in Python, C++, Javascript, SQL, CSS and HTML.
- My main interests are science, poetry, art and games.
- I’m currently working in a quite interesting but also time consuming project, so not really willing to get into new ones at the moment, but who knows? You can always try.
- See you around.
